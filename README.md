Full Stack Developer & AI Engineer | Architecting Scalable, Python-Powered Intelligent Systems

I specialize in building robust, end-to-end applications that merge full-stack development with cutting-edge AI. With a strong foundation in Python and cloud-native architectures, I design intelligent systems that are scalable, secure, and production-ready.

Past experience includes:
• Building backend systems in Python using Django, FastAPI, and Flask
• Developing dynamic frontends with React, Vue.js, and TypeScript
• Designing RESTful & GraphQL APIs and architecting microservices
• Integrating AI/ML solutions using Azure AI, LangChain, OpenAI, and vector databases
• Deploying on AWS, Azure, and GCP with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines
• Implementing MLOps workflows via SageMaker, MLflow, and Kubeflow

Currently, I’m focused on building agentic AI systems and Python-first intelligent applications that enable real-time reasoning, decision-making, and automation across domains.
